title: View HTTP/HTTPS Traffic Easily via MITM Proxy
date: '2025-07-04'
tags: ['scala', 'tool']
draft: false
summary: 'A lightweight MITM (Man‚ÄëIn‚ÄëThe‚ÄëMiddle) proxy that logs HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses in a browser UI. Perfect for debugging HTTPS APIs, mobile apps, webhooks, and Java-based services.'
---

## üöÄ Why I Built It

I often need to inspect HTTPS traffic locally‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs from browser clients, mobile apps, or Java services. Existing tools felt heavyweight or lacked Java KeyStore (JKS) support. So I built **log‚Äëhttp‚Äëproxy** to be:

- Simple to set up (via SBT or Docker)
- Able to use self-signed certs (via mkcert) and JKS
- Featuring clean browser-based traffic viewer

---

## üß© Features

- **MITM proxy** for HTTP and HTTPS
- **Live browser UI** showing full request/response, headers, body
- **DNS override**: route specific domains (e.g. `example.com`) to local proxy
- **JKS support**: for Java services trusting a keystore
- **Docker-ready**: one command to build and run

---

## ‚úîÔ∏è Use Cases
- Reverse-engineer or audit HTTPS API calls
- Debug HTTPS webhooks or mobile-app network flows
- Inspect traffic in Java services trusted via JKS

For specific usage instructions, please see the project's [README.md](https://github.com/timzaak/log-http-proxy?tab=readme-ov-file).

## üì£ Feedback & Future Plans
I'm actively considering adding:
- Request/response filtering and search in UI
- Metrics or logging to files
If you're using this proxy in your workflows, I'd love to hear:
- What use-cases are most helpful?
- Any missing features you'd value?
