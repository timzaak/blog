summary: Welcome To My Blog

The purpose of setting up this blog is mainly because, although using GitHub Issues to record content is quick and convenient, it is not suitable for dissemination and systematic organization. The reading experience for non-programmers is also quite poor.

I wanted to migrate the content elsewhere, but the platforms I found generally had the following issues:

1. [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev/), it's simple and easy to write blogs, but image requires a paid plan.
2. Medium and OSChina do not natively support Markdown, requiring third-party tools for conversion.

Therefore, I chose [tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) to solve the template issue and host it on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

In the future, I will prioritize migrating content from GitHub Issues, organize the project page, and then consider adding new content.
